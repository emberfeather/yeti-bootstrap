Simple snowball debt calculator for illustrating faster debt repayment.

This project is an exercise in the following:

  * Helping people get out of debt.
  * Using HTML5 and CSS3 technologies.
  * Simplifying the snowball process.
  * Having fun!

## Browser Support

Most modern browsers with JavaScript/jQuery should be supported.

Tested in the following:

  * Chrome
  * FireFox
  * IE - 9+

IE8 is known to not be working. There were some errors that are showing from the jQuery 1.7 library but they could be 
specific to the jQuery template library or the Yeti code. I wasn't able to get enough information or willpower to dig 
into the errors further.
